# MusicDownloadScript
download spotify, amazon music, and tidal from powershell

Paste the script into a text editor (notepad, etc) 

## Step 1: Open PowerShell with Admin Rights
To run the script, you'll need to use PowerShell with administrative privileges since installing software typically requires such permissions.

Search for PowerShell in the Start menu.
Right-click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click Yes to allow PowerShell to run with administrative privileges.

## Step 2: Prepare the Script
Copy the PowerShell script provided in the previous message.
Open Notepad or another text editor, paste the script there.
Modify the script as necessary. For example, you might need to change the URLs to the installers if they have been updated or if you want to change the download location.

## Step 3: Save the Script

In Notepad, click File > Save As.
Choose a location to save the script.
Enter a filename followed by .ps1 extension (e.g., InstallMusicApps.ps1). The .ps1 extension is for PowerShell scripts.
Change Save as type to All Files.
Click Save

## Step 4: Run the Script

Now, return to the PowerShell window you opened with administrative privileges.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the cd command. For example, if you saved the script to C:\Scripts, you would type cd C:\Scripts and press Enter.
Execute the script by typing .\ScriptName.ps1, replacing ScriptName.ps1 with the name you gave your script file, and press Enter. For example, if your script is named InstallMusicApps.ps1, you would type .\InstallMusicApps.ps1.
Step 5: Follow Any Installation Prompts
Depending on how the installation scripts are set up and whether they support silent installation, you might see on-screen prompts during the installation process. Follow these prompts to complete the installations.
